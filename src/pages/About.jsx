        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hi! I'm Sarah, a data analyst who loves making messy work simple.
          I specialize in automating business processes, building dashboards in Power BI,
          and finding insights that actually help people make decisions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I’ve worked in finance, education, and tech — combining data and storytelling.
          Now I'm building a portfolio that reflects what I do best: making data work.
